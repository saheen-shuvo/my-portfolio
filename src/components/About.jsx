      <p className=" text-[10px] md:text-lg text-gray-400 text-justify leading-relaxed">
        My journey in web development began with a fascination for how digital experiences are built. Over time, that curiosity evolved into a passion for crafting modern, scalable, and user-friendly applications that seamlessly blend creativity with functionality. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I specialize in React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, developing applications that are not only visually engaging but also highly
        efficient under the hood. From intuitive dashboards to full-stack
        web platforms, I enjoy transforming complex ideas into smooth, interactive experiences with clean and maintainable code. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Beyond development, Iâ€™m passionate about working for people and making a positive impact. I dedicate my free time to volunteering, where I contribute to meaningful projects and help others achieve their goals. My mission? To leverage my skills to empower businesses and individuals, turning their ideas into impactful digital solutions that grow and scale.
