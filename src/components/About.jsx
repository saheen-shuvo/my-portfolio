          My journey in web development began with a fascination for how digital
          experiences are built. Over time, that curiosity evolved into a
          passion for crafting modern, scalable, and user-friendly applications
          that seamlessly blend creativity with functionality.

          I specialize in React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, developing
          applications that are not only visually engaging but also highly
          efficient under the hood. From intuitive dashboards to full-stack web
          platforms, I enjoy transforming complex ideas into smooth, interactive
          experiences with clean and maintainable code.
